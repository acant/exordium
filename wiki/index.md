==================

Finally choose
[exoridum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exordium_(rhetoric)) (the introduction
of an oration in classical Western rhetoric) for a few reasons:

* a personal or group website site is kind of an introduction
* I think it sounds cools
* is a reference to a [time travelling
  communication method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_in_Revelation_Space#Exordium) in [Alastair Reynolds](http://www.alastairreynolds.com/) [Revelation Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation_Space_universe) novels, because I am a giant nerd
